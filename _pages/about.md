I’m a robotics researcher at Vinmotion. Before coming to Vinmotion, I earned my B.Eng. in Control Engineering and Automation from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in Vietnam. I also worked as a research scientist at HUST, where I focused on reinforcement learning and optimal control.

My research lies at the intersection of optimization, robots, and control, with a particular focus on developing new methods for humanoid robots. Currently, I’m particularly interested in humanoid robots and intelligent control such as MPC, RL, and sampling-based optimal control. 
<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
