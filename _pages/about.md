I’m a robotics researcher at Vinmotion. Before coming to Vinmotion, I earned my B.Eng. in Control Engineering and Automation from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in Vietnam. I also worked as a research scientist at HUST, where I focused on reinforcement learning and optimal control.

My research lies at the intersection of optimization, robots, and control, with a particular focus on developing new methods for humanoid robots. Currently, I’m particularly interested in humanoid robots and intelligent control such as MPC, RL, and sampling-based optimal control.
